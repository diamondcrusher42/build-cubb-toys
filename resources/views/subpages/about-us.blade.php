            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p><strong>We are a team</strong> of enthusiast builders, who want to <u>revolutionize</u> the way building block are created, build and played with.</p>
            <p><strong>We believe</strong> that <u>anybody can be a creator</u>, that anybody can share their ideas and be rewarded for them if others find it valuable and useful.</p>
            <p><strong>We created</strong> our first project, build unique new models and <u>turned our idea into a real product</u>, that you can order and start building.</p>
            <p><strong>We risked</strong> our own money and went to all this trouble, to show you, that <u>your idea can become a successful business.</u></p>
            <p><strong>Now we are building</strong> the next step, our platform <u>CUBB - Create Unique Building Blocks</u>, where anybody can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>submit their build, their idea</li>
                <li>get funding for a prototype build</li>
                <li>deliver and test the first build to real customers</li>
                <li>create a final product to be mass produced</li>
                <li>start selling your product and earn income from your idea</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>We have the power</strong> to <u>transform our ideas into reality</u> and build all the sets that we always wanted to play with.</p>
            <p><strong>Join us</strong> and other builders in <u>creating a new paradigm</u> for all who love to imagine, build, play and create with building blocks.</p>
