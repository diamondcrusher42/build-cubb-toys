            <h1>FAQs</h1>
            <h2>1. Who can submit an idea?</h2>
            <p>Anybody over 18 years can submit an idea. The idea must be your own, new, unique and must not contain trademarked and copyrighted material.</p>
            <h2>2. Who can support and invest in a product?</h2>
            <p>We have several levels of support, from preordering the product with 50% discount, to small and large cash investment in the terms of a loan that earns you interest. Anyone over the age of 18 can be a supporter / investor. </p>
            <h2>3. What payment options are available?</h2>
            <p>We are setting up several types of payment options for supporters and investors, some are already available, some will be added during the next weeks / months, depending on the provider.</p>
            <p>We (plan to) support:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bank wire transfer (live)</li>
                <li>Paypal (in development)</li>
                <li>Credit card payment (in development)</li>
                <li>Stripe (in development)</li>
                <li>Paxum (in development)</li>
                <li>Virtual currency (in development)</li>
                <li>Apple pay (in development)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>4. Who is receiving the funds?</h2>
            <p>All funds collected through the CUBB platform goes to our company Halcer d.o.o., registered in EU, Slovenia. Here the funds will be stored in a separate project conto on our bank account, and released only if the project is successful in raising the target funds. We will use the funds to make direct payouts to our production partners, so every payment will always be accounted for in our cost structure.</p>
            <h2>5. What happens if a project fails?</h2>
            <p>Every project has its risks, which we as experienced entrepreneurs are very well aware of. We aim to minimize that risk by defining the fundraising process into manageable steps. This lower risk, as the projects will have to prove themselves, gain traction, feedback, and demonstrated demand. To safeguard your funds, we store all received capital until the successful completion of the funding goal. If the project fails to raise the required capital, all funds will be returned to investors, with a small charge of 5€ for preorders, and 30€ for investmenst, to cover the cost of return transactions.</p>
            <h2>6. What happens if a project raises the required funds, gets manufactured, but the finished product cannot be sold?</h2>
            <p>In the case that the project is funded successfully, gets manufactured and distributed to our sales channels, but fails to sell the available stock, all investors will receive partial repayments from available funds and then vote on what will happen with the remaining stock (discounted price, buyout, repayment in stock,... etc.). Our goal is to ensure that each project is vetted in advance for quality, price/performance and market demand, to avoid such scenarios.</p>
            <h2>7. How much is the creator paid?</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to create a business model for creators, where we turn their ideas into a passive income stream, where they earn a commission for each product sold. The creators will receive a 10% cut of the raised funds in the first campaign and 2% cut of all future production value (ex. we pay 200.000 EUR for the manufacture of the product, and you receive a 4.000 EUR cut).</p>
            <h2>8. How is the money managed?</h2>
            <p>We understand that every investor is concerned about how safely their investment is handled. Especially when building physical products, proper cost management is key to long-term success. That is why every product has an expense projection, that we constantly update, to insure the funds are always properly managed and that all projects are within the projected expenses.</p>
            <h2>9. What experience does your team have</h2>
            <p>Our team has prototyped, build, launched, and sold 60.000+ units from several projects in the past years. We have already established all the required contracts and relationships with our design, manufacture, distribution, and promotion partners, which gives us a detailed insight into all the costs associated with the IDEA TO PRODUCT process. So all expenses are known in advance and we always leave a margin for potential cost increase (shipping, storage, etc.).</p>
            <h2>10. What are the cost of project</h2>
            <p>Each project will have to cover similar cost to get to market:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>creating a 3d model & prototyping the build</li>
                <li>artwork for the project (packaging, box, instructions, models)</li>
                <li>build instructions design (book, video)</li>
                <li>marketing material (picture, video)</li>
                <li>manufacturing</li>
                <li>printing</li>
                <li>quality control</li>
                <li>logistics</li>
                <li>storage</li>

                <li>promotion</li>
                <li>creator fee</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>11. What is the timeline of the project funding</h2>
            <p>Each idea will go through several steps before it will end up as a product in the hands of a customer. This naturally takes time, for which our investors are compensated with interest. Total time from idea to product on the shelf: ~360 days </p>
            <p>The general (best case) timeline of a product is:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>project is available at target country, arrival to fulfillment center, start of sales to customers (14 days)</li>
                <li>project is sold out and all payments / returns processed ( 140 days)</li>
                <li>investor payouts begin</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            <h3>INVESTOR</h3>

            <h2>13. When do payouts for investors begin?</h2>

            <h2>14. What if a project is behind schedule?</h2>
            <p>All investors will receive partial payments after 1 year, even If a project isn't sold out. After 2 years from funding, investors will be asked to vote on how they wish to proceeded with any remaining unsold stock.</p>
            <h2>15. What if I want to invest larger sums of capital</h2>
