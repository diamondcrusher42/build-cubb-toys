            <h1>How it works</h1>
            <p>Our CUBB platform works as a connection between CREATORS, SUPPORTERS and INVESTORS, where they each provide value to each other.</p>
            <p><strong>Creator</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>help investors make money from their projects</li>
                <li>create possibilities for investors to support projects they believe in</li>
                <li>offer a direct channel where people can connect and help shape ideas into great projects</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Supporter</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>helps the projects by preordering the product and receive a 50% discount</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Investor</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>can fund creators directly</li>
                <li>help bring more products to underserved markets</li>
                <li>enable the projects to grow their following and build active communities</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>7 STEPS FROM IDEA TO A PRODUCT YOU </h2>
            <p>All of the magic happens in just 7 steps.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A creator submits an idea on the CUBB platform</li>
                <li>Out team checks the quality of the build, identifies potential problems (copyright, patents, etc..), and works with the creator to transform the idea into a project</li>
                <li>The project is published on the CUBB platform and starts to raise funds from supporters and investors</li>
                <li>We manufacture the FIRST EDITION of product with the funds, to deliver the product to early backers and start to promote the build design.</li>
                <li>We collect feedback and reviews from our customes and improve any problems that were identified.</li>
                <li>We build the SECOND EDITION product and expand fulfillment to online stores and additional markets and build further recognition.</li>
                <li>The last step is to optimize all processes, to lower cost and improve margins in the last funding round for the THIRD EDITION production, where we expand to worldwide delivery and retail stores.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How do we know that it only takes 7 steps?</h3>
            <p>Because our team has already gone through this process with our own pilot project, discovering each step, identifying all problems and the most efficient solutions to bring YOU this formula for the success of YOUR idea, YOUR project.</p>
