            <p>Hi, and welcome to our CUBB platform. </p>
            <p>We help you <strong>C</strong>reate <strong>U</strong>nique <strong>B</strong>uilding <strong>B</strong>locks and turn those ideas into products that we launch on the world market and start earning you money.</p>
            <p><strong>We are a team of enthusiast builders, who want to revolutionize the way building block sets are created, produced and played with.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>We believe that anybody can be a creator, that anybody can share their ideas and be rewarded for them if others find it valuable and useful.</strong></p>
            <h2>How launching a product used to work</h2>
            <p>We created our first prototypes from blocks, build 3D models for them, tested them and spent several months searching for the best way to manufacture them. After that we raised funds from family, friends and investors and manufactured the blocks, instructions, packaging. After that we had to secure a transport, file a bunch of forms to declare customs and import the products, then store them in a warehouse. Finally we were ready to launch the product and then spend another year to market the listing, to finally sell the product with a profit.</p>
            <p>In total, we spent 2+ years doing all the hard work, so you don’t have to anymore.</p>
            <p><strong>Today, thanks to CUBB platform, anybody can submit their build idea, get funding for a product to be mass produced, and start earning passive income from your idea, each time a product is sold.</strong></p>
            <h2>This is your time to shine.</h2>
            <p>Submit your ideas and join us in a new world for all who love to create, and start earning money from your ideas.</p>

            <p>More about the CUBB creator program:</p>
            <h3>Who can become a creator</h3>
            <p>Anybody over 18 years can submit an idea. </p>
            <h3>What ideas are eligible</h3>
            <p>The idea must be your own, new, unique and must not contain trademarked and copyrighted material.</p>
            <h3>How much do I get paid for my idea</h3>
            <p>Our goal is to create a business model for creators, where we turn their ideas into a passive income stream, where they earn a commission for each product sold. </p>
            <p>The creators will receive a 10% cut of the raised funds in the first campaign and 2% cut of all future production value.</p>
            <h3>When will I receive my first payment</h3>
            <p>You will receive your 10% cut as soon as the project has successfully finished raising funds.</p>
            <h3>What if a project doesn’t get funded?</h3>
            <p>Every project has its risks, which we as experienced entrepreneurs are very well aware of. If the project fails to raise the required capital, all funds will be returned to investors, with no charge to you as the creator.</p>
