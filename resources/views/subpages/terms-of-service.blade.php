            <p>SECTION 1.1 – ONLINE CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM TERMS</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Our CUBB platform works as a connection between CREATORS, SUPPORTERS and INVESTORS, where they all provide value to each other.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We believe that anybody can be a CREATOR, that anybody can share their ideas and be rewarded for them if others find it valuable and useful.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>SUPPORTERS are our early adopters, those who believe in the product and are prepared to support the team now and wait for the product to be build.</p>
            <p>Supporters have 2 main benefits:</p>
            <p>– can preorder the product with a 50% discount on the retail price</p>
            <p>– will get priority fulfillment, you will be the first to receive the product</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>INVESTORS are the ones who help fund the production cost and receive interest and a free product as a reward.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Anyone over the age of 18 can be a supporter / investor.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Investor benefits are divided into 3 tiers, depending on the sum of the investment:</p>
            <p>– SILVER, pledge at least 1000 EUR, receive 110% funds + FREE product</p>
            <p>– GOLD, pledge at least 5000 EUR, receive 120% funds + FREE product</p>
            <p>– PLATINUM, pledge at least 10000 EUR, receive 130% funds + FREE product</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Do we support investments larger than 10.000 EUR</p>
            <p>Yes. Contact our team directly at <a href="mailto:build@cubbtoys.com">build@cubbtoys.com</a> to discuss larger investments. We are happy to make you a special deal, based on your investment preferences, but this usually takes more time and is more complicated.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Funds management</p>
            <p>All funds collected through the CUBB platform goes to our company Halcer d.o.o., registered in EU, Slovenia. Here the funds will be stored in a separate project conto on our bank account, and released only if the project is successful in raising the target funds. We will use the funds to make direct payouts to our production partners, so every payment will always be accounted for in our cost structure.Every product has an expense projection, that we constantly update, to insure the funds are always properly managed and that all projects are within the projected profit margins.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Funds &amp; interest payout</p>
            <p>All payouts will be made after the project is sold out, which we estimate to about 360-720 days from successful fundraising. Some projects might take longer to sell, at least at the start of the platform operation. As we grow with each project, we estimate that the time from funding to payout will decrease, enabling projects to pay our investors sooner.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Risk and dangers</p>
            <p>If the project fails to raise the required capital, all funds will be returned to investors, with a small charge of 5€ for preorders, and 15€ for investments, to cover the cost of return transactions. If a project is successfully funded, but is behind on sales, a partial payment will be made to all investors after 1 year from the time the project was made available to sell to customers. After that the partial payouts will be every 6 months until the project is sold out. In the event that after 2 years from the time the project was made available to sell to customers, the project still hasn’t sold out, the investors will be asked to vote on how they wish to proceeded with any remaining unsold stock.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to ensure that each project is vetted in advance for quality, price/performance and market demand, to avoid such scenarios.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>How are the creators paid?</p>
            <p>Our goal is to create a business model for creators, where we turn their ideas into a passive income stream, where they earn a commission for each product sold. The creators will receive a 10% cut of the raised funds in the first campaign and 2% cut of all future production value (ex. we raise 100.000 EUR for the manufacture of the product, and you receive 10% of that which amounts to a 10.000 EUR payment).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>What is the timeline of the project funding</p>
            <p>Each idea will go through several steps before it will end up as a product in the hands of a customer. This naturally takes time, for which our investors are compensated with interest.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The timeline of a product is:</p>
            <p>– idea is submitted, reviewed and confirmed as a project</p>
            <p>– crowdfunding starts to raise capital for FIRST PRODUCTION</p>
            <p>– the project has raised funds and is going into production</p>
            <p>– the project is finished and going to quality control</p>
            <p>– the project is boxed and shipped via sea freight</p>
            <p>– the project arrives to destination country and is subject to import</p>
            <p>– project is available at target country, arrival to fulfillment center, start of sales to customers</p>
            <p>– project is sold out and all payments / returns processed</p>
            <p>– investor payouts begin</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Intellectual rights, rights to the original content and artwork of the projects</p>
            <p>When the product is created on the platform, the intellectual rights to use, market, sell, distribute, licence and create follow up products, or products in the same genre belong to our company Halcer d.o.o. / Halcer Ltd. All creators will receive credit and compensation if we choose to commercialize their original work.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We reward creators for their original work with a creator fee, for their first project. Additionally we include the creators in all subsequent orders of the original project.</p>
